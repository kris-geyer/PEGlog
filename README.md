Android SDK version 8.1 interferes with data collection and affects many applications that rely on background operations. This may be the result of a bug in this version of Android, which may be patched shortly. 

This does not affect the majority of devices, which currently run Android SDK 8.0.0 or earlier. 

We are working on a fix.
